[View a Step-by-step Instruction "How to Use"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4zMhovBgO7rsPIzJk_15v0sdhiCpnjuacoDEfmzGEw/)

= How to change or override plugin templates? =

Plugin template files can be found in the `/wp-content/plugins/gallery-plugin/templates/` directory.
You can edit these files in an upgrade-safe way using overrides. Copy them into a directory with your theme named `/bws-templates`.

Example: To override the single gallery template, please copy `/wp-content/plugins/gallery-plugin/templates/gallery-single-template.php` to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/bws-templates/gallery-single-template.php`.

Do not edit these files in the plugin's core directly as they are overwritten during the upgrade process and any customizations will be lost.

= I'm getting the following error: "Fatal error: Call to undefined function get_post_thumbnail_id()". What should I do? =

This error means that your theme doesn't support thumbnail option, in order to add this option please find the file 'functions.php' in your theme and add the following strings to this file:

`add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
    add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
}`

After that your theme will support thumbnail option and the error will disappear.

= How to change image order on the single gallery page? =

Please open the menu "Galleries" and choose a gallery from the list. It will take you to the gallery editing page. Use the drag and drop function to change the order of the images and do not forget to save the post. Do not forget to select `Sort images by` -> `Sorting order in the Gallery` in the plugin settings.

= I am using WP with rtl language and I have a problem with the lightbox displaying on iPad/iPhone. =

1. In the file header.php you should substitute `<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>` with `<html>`
2. Remove the "direction:rtl" from the css of the body, and move it to the main wrapper. For example, in your theme CSS file (usually it's rtl.css) remove the following lines:

`body {
    direction:rtl;
}`

and add (for the themes Twenty Eleven or Twenty Ten):

`.hfeed {
    direction: rtl;
}`

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)
